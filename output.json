Dave is a beloved father to Deidre and Nicole and an incredible grandpa to Brazil, Guinness, and Nuala. He is a significant part of the Lahaina community, coaching soccer for the Lahainaluna Girls Soccer team and the Lahaina Women's Soccer team for years. He has taken countless tourists to visit the humpback whales when he captained his boat out of Lahaina Harbor. We fondly remember how he would play classical music for the whales, a tip of his hat to our dad, Dr. Louis Rockett. Dave and his family are inspiring examples of aloha and the power of 'ohana. Even while he has lost so much, he is positive and boosting our spirits during this tragedy."

My parents, Robert and Linda Colley, managed to evacuate from their home of nearly 40 years in Wahikuli with little more than the clothes on their back. The house, along with hundreds of others, burned to the ground. My Mom is a Kishi, daughter of Richard (Kazuo) and Margaret. They owned and operated Kishi Market in Front Street for many many years. That building, sadly, is also no more. My Dad was a Realtor in West Maui for decades, helping countless clients find the perfect house for their families. He was self employed as Colley & Associates (the associates being my mom, and many times myself as chief envelope stuffer and filer of things as a child). This is intended to help them pay for supplies, transportation, and other basic necessities."

Luckily enough she was able to evacuate just before her apartment in Lahaina Surf burned down. She lived on the 2nd floor, and with no time to spare, she left everything including her two cats who unfortunately did not make it. She immigrated from the Philippines almost 20 years ago and struggled here as a single parent raising three kids on her own as best as she could. My mom did everything she could for us, this is the only option I got. I understand with the economy we live in a majority of us already suffer living paycheck to paycheck. I'm hoping this reaches the kind souls who aren't worried about their financial situation. A little goes a long way, God bless us all."

While we are so relieved they escaped and are now safe, the family faces the dreadful reality of picking up the pieces in the aftermath.

Monica and Walter and family have generously hosted many friends and family from all over the world on their visits to Maui. They are deeply connected to their community and have fostered kids in need as well as volunteering to help the elderly or anyone in need, never expecting a thing in return."

We’ve started this Go Fund Me to help her in the interim before insurance kicks in, and to assist with the many many costs that insurance inevitably will not cover. All of her savings were tied up in the apartment, and everything she owned outside of the suitcase she brought here.

My 92 year old mother, Wanda Kitaguchi (pictured in cover photo), was one of the many who lost their home. Left behind was all of her belongings (with the exception of a few essentials/couple pairs of clothes). She evacuated at the last minute alongside my daughter who also left home with close to nothing. It pains me to say that my brother who also resided with them there, Albert Kitaguchi, has still not been located since the night of 8/8. In efforts to look for my brother, my daughter drove through active fire/power lines/thick black smoke with little visibility on two separate occasions the night of the fire, and watched our home engulfed in flames. My mother, Wanda Kitaguchi, immigrated from Japan to Lahaina in 1953, alongside my Lahaina born father, James S. Kitaguchi (departed). So many memories, so much blood, sweat, and tears, countless irreplaceable family photo albums and memorabilia, journals upon journals of daily logs that my mom would write every evening, all of her \"broke da mouth\" recipes she has spent her whole life collecting from different people and places, gone into the ashes and rubble before they even knew it. Beyond the material things, our Wahikuli home held so much more meaning, history, and depth. Funds earned will go toward providing basic essential items, hotel stay costs, and potentially reestablishing their home in the far future."

My brother, his girlfriend and their dog were woken up from the smoke, flames and screams. Very confused and scared, they tried to get out of the area as fast as possible, but were met in gridlock with other vehicles. They barely made it out of the area alive. With no gas and damage to their van, they walked to kaanapali until they kept being told to move out towards Honokowai. They waited for days with no help. With no sleep, food and barely any water, they made a desperate decision to go back on foot to siphon gas from abandoned cars so they could hopefully drive back out to town. There was no warning that the fires were spreading quickly and we’re thankful that they are ok."

This is to help her recover from the loss of her home.This is Vivian Ichiki, born in Lahaina and lived at her home on Kauaula Road for almost 50 years. She was an active member of the community; you’d often find her and her friends on Front Street selling leis to raise money for Lahainaluna High School scholarship fund and volunteering at Lahaina Senior Citizen Center, Lahaina Adult Daycare Center as well as many local churches. Like so many other families and friends, her home was lost in the devastating fire that also took her entire neighborhood. Her belongings, her home, and everything in it was lost. While her memories, photos, and family heirlooms can never be replaced, our immediate goal is to help support Vivian in her senior years, as her home is no longer a viable option, and help recover some of what was lost in the fire."

On August 9, 2023, our parents fled for their lives on Maui and lost their home in Lahaina, as well as their personal belongings, work tools, clothing, medical supplies, photos, and other family treasures to the fires. They fled without time to pack their things, so the clothes on their backs are all they have left. Our Mom and Dad are pillars of their community, and they are grounding in the support of their church community—where they are emergency sheltering and taking things day-to-day—right now. Despite losing nearly everything, they are committed to staying on Maui and helping their Ohana out and toward recovery, together. As Dad said, he will not leave his people."

Instead, she and Kevin fled to higher ground. They are waiting to return but expect to find that everything they owned was completely decimated by the fire. Kevin and Tasha are active members of the Lahaina community. Kevin is a boat captain for Makai Adventures. The boat Kevin captained was lost in the fire, leaving him with an uncertain future income. Tasha works as a server and bartender and hostess at the local Honu restaurant. No one knows if it’s still standing. I hope you’ll give anything you can to help them to replace their belongings and set up a new home for their growing family."

Jac and Andrew bought their home with every penny they had at a young age because they knew they wanted to grow a family in Lahaina. They rolled up their sleeves together, literally, and over the years spent hundreds of hours personally making the house into a \"home.\" After many years of slowly renovating and budget rebuilding, all while growing their family (having 3 children) they finally reached a point where they were comfortable and not sleeping in a construction zone. They entertained visitors and shared their space with many friends and co-workers. They planted a garden, raised chickens, hosted their children's birthdays, and shared the special memories of family life in Lahaina. Their sense of respect and community pride, appreciation for the culture, and knowledge of the land/ocean is astounding. Although Andrew and Jaclyn are safe and surrounded by family and support, I set up this Crowdfund for them, as they are too emotional at the moment. I know they are humble and I know they will use any funds to support themselves,\ntheir children, and/or the community in Lahaina. Their goal right now is to hang on to their burned land without having to foreclose in hopes to rebuild the \"home,\" not the house."

On August 8th my parents were impacted immensely by the wildfires that tore through Lahaina and burnt their house to the ground. My parents lived in south Lahaina on Front st, with our two loving sweet yellow labradors Molly & Dakota. They are mom and daughter ages 9 & 5. My mom ran a wonderful business from home supplying families in need with baby items which is what brought her to Lahaina. She was previously living in Makawao but moved to Lahaina due to how well her business was doing on the west side. The morning the fires broke out my mom was doing business in Kahului trying to get baby seats to a visiting family. They were trying to rush home, but when they reached the Maui ocean center they were met with road closures and traffic making it impossible to get home. They had to sleep on the side of the road & our dogs were home all alone. They were trying to get ahold of neighbors to grab the dogs before evacuating but there was no luck due to cell towers being down. We are really hoping that they got rescued and made it out safely but we will not know until everything is okay to return too. We still have gotten no word whether or not they are safe and are trying to remain hopeful. My parents lost everything, clothes, medicine, food, pictures, and so much more. 100% of the money raised will be going towards my parents to aid them with the rescue of our dogs, medicine, clothing, food, and basic essentials they need."

They are all lifelong Lahaina residents working in the community they love and are known for their generous and kind gestures to friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Wendy taught for over 30 years at King Kamehameha III Elementary School, which was also destroyed in the fire. We hope to show them the love and support that they gave to so many others.The funds will go directly to these three families that lost their homes in the devasting fires to help them rebuild their homes and lives in beautiful Lahaina.

We are very lucky to have Trinity safe and with us today. For the past two years, she has dedicated her life to managing and growing the LahAina Surf Shack. Trinity considers her surf instructors, students, and their families as her ohana (family). Trinity coordinated and supported the families of the keiki (children's) programs at the surf shop; she also served as a community organizer for beach cleanups. Trinity has been part of the convoys transporting resources around the island, and as of Saturday, August 12, 2023 Trinity is now volunteering with the Red Cross in their community centers. She is also working to organize an ice pack exchange so that all of those displaced will have a way to keep their coolers cold. Maui is Trinity's life; there is nowhere else she calls home. Immediate needs include housing, a new laptop, and a surfboard - much needed for mental health!"

Together with Grandma Emi, they worked hard over the next decade or so to make it a home and happily welcomed two more sisters (Sarah and Annabelle) with their families from the Phillipines, and Hesard's mother to live with them. At a full house of 10 there was always a lot of life here, a lot of memories made, a lot of memories kept. This was a home and a promise of a new life in America. This was a place to come home to at the end of the day, a place to stay, talk story, and sing karaoke with family, a place to celebrate birthdays and graduations, a place to be together and mourn the loss of loved ones, a place to play with all the family pets, a place to cook and enjoy delectable home cooked meals, and yes during Covid this was a place for school too. This home was full of life. Please, we are asking for help for the whole family to get back up on their feet, to begin again."

Thank God she was safe with her wonderful caregiver Tu'u on the other side of the island, at the time the fire occurred, but her ongoing treatment is a large financial expense that must be maintained. In 2018 he was awarded the \"Maui Peace Hero\" award for his selfless service to the community of Maui. Not only has he donated his time, talent, energy and resources for the greater good of Maui throughout his past 40+ years of residency, but has also served our country in the US Navy. Asking you from the bottom of my heart to help this wonderful man get back onto his feet so that he can continue to spread God's love, helping make miracles happen on Maui and throughout the world!"

        "description": "Recently a devastating fire has swept through the island of Maui destroying completely the town of Lahaina. The gravity of the situation is immense and tragic, striking all members of the community. In particular, my brother, Jordan, his wife, Tiff, and 1 year old son, Milo were victims of this fire. Luckily all three of them are safe but their whole possessional life has been lost to the fire. The fire not only burned through their neighborhood but burned to the harbor where my brother worked on numerous boats, destroying his entire work. His office, workshop, and his boats have been consumed by the fire. Additionally, his wife who is a professional photographer is now jobless too as the fire has halted tourism and most of her equipment was consumed in the fire. They now must find a way to provide for themselves and their young son, jobless and without a home to return to. Everything has been lost but two suitcases and their lives. The few words here can not fully encompass the devastation that has occurred. The funds raised here will go directly to them, helping to stabilize themselves amid the instability and insecurity disaster brings, as they navigate rebuilding their lives. All financial donations are appreciated along with prayers."

The house was erected in the mid-1950s by my late grandfather, Takeo, and it has been the humble home of my family ever since then. In the efforts to evacuate the house promptly, we were unable to secure anything else besides our family members (three elderly and two dogs, as well as my mother, father, and I). In that process, we were unable to secure any personal belongings and were forced to flee Lahaina with little more than the clothes on our backs. If you can find it in your heart, my family and I are asking for your generosity today. Anything you give will be helping us to subsidize the cost of living while we try to navigate the uncertain times that lie before us."

They need assistance for food, clothes, and hopefully another place to call home."

        "description": "My name is Preston Zimmerman, and as you likely already know, the Hawaiian town of Lahaina, Maui has been destroyed by a Wildfire. My sister, Rachael Zimmerman, and her partner, Nicole Nakamura thankfully made it out of the fire without any serious physical harm. They were only able to grab their dog Ziya, a bike, and each other before they had to leave their home. Unfortunately, we just received confirmation that their condo complex, was lost in the raging fires that destroyed this historic neighborhood. Currently, Rachael will be out of work as the tourism industry in her area will be deeply affected by the fires, and as a photographer, Rachael relied on tourists who have her capture their special moments, from engagements & weddings to surf lessons and family portraits. Nicole will be unable to support her clients due to the impact of the devastation and having to rebuild. She is unsure if she will have capacity to work. The money you donate will go toward ensuring their continued health and safety and any other needs that may arise in these difficult and trying times."

Our entire home burned to the ground. We are in shock and don’t know where to start. I have never asked for help, but I am in crisis. The sewing business I have built over the last seven years is completely gone. All four of my sewing machines were lost including my $4,000 serger that made every bikini for my business. I lost thousands of dollars just in fabric and supplies, not including all of our other possessions that were left behind. One day I will bring my business back, but all funds will go towards purchasing basic necessities for me and my family. Housing, clothes, medication for Brewer, literally everything needs to be replaced. Anything can help at this time and is truly appreciated. Mahalo for all of your love and support. I would be nothing without you all.\""

Their home was in Lahaina, where they loved spending time in their backyard with their adorable 3 year old rescue dog, Haku.

Kyle took over the business in 2018, and built a culture that prioritized community, caring and friendship. Folks would come from all over and learn to surf with teachers who practice Aloha in every way. When the fires came on August 8, 2023, there was no preparation for the devastation. The shop- ironically an historic building, the old fire station- burned to the ground and reduced to ash. From aerial photos it is clear nothing survived. The employees have lost everything. Most are now homeless and now have lost their livelihoods for the time being. We are thankful that all employees have been accounted for, it is going to be a long road of rebuilding. We learned that Kyle does not have property insurance. He is applying for every federal loan available, but it is not enough. We are devastated that our beloved shop is gone.

Their family home of 55 years was destroyed by the ravaging wildfire that tore through the beautiful town of Lahaina. Uncle Remy, Royale and Randal evacuated quickly and sadly had to leave all of their possessions behind. They were also forced to make the heartbreaking decision to leave behind their family pets that included 9 cats (Chong, Shadow, Ghost, Whisper, Stoney, Meanie, Goldie, Tiny and Nanu), 8 chickens and 2 lovebirds (Rocky and Adrian). If you know our Maui family you know that they are always the life of the party, where at any time any one of them can tell the funniest story, makes us laugh with crazy jokes or entertain us with beautiful voices. We understand that many across the island of Maui are dealing with the devastation so any donation given is greatly appreciated. The funds raised will help provide the family with the means to purchase groceries and all other necessities for day-to-day living. It will also give them peace of mind as they try to sort out how they are going to get through this as they start their search for housing and employment."

I’m creating this for them due to that fact that it’s been a very hard few days and they are over whelmed by everything that has happened just three days ago. My father is also a firefighter and has been out helping to find anyone that might have made it through this tragedy. The cover picture I have posted is of my father looking onto the rubble that once was his house that he built with his own hands, while doing his rounds. Asking for help is hard but they literally have nothing to their name and all I can do to help is ask. any amount of donation will be greatly appreciated. Please do know that your hard earned $$ will be going to a family that will guarantee be helping others while dealing with this tragedy themselves."

This is a difficult time for many that will need to rebuild from scratch. Thank you to those who have reached out in any of the ways. Through some of these correspondences we received requests to set up a GoFundMe to be able to provide Joy and Mike with some assistance. Joy is currently in the hospital suffering from burns and smoke inhalation recieved while waiting for aid from first responders. She watched her car explode and was pelted by glass and shrapnel while in the rough ocean that evening evading the heat from the devastation unfolding before her eyes. This was not an easy feat as she is recovering from recent spinal fusion surgery. Mike had been helping the Napili Point deal with the severe winds when he received the news of the extreme happenings in Lahaina. Putting a financial number on this trama is impossible! Anything you can do to help them rebuild is Most Appreciated!!"

She is one among many who have lost their home, job and livelihood in the structure fire's devastation. Many community members were forced to evacuate their homes with only a few minutes or less to prepare. I am so grateful Emma is safe and non-injured, as she has been visiting me off-island, but it was a long night of no contact with neighbors and friends whose powerlines were destroyed in the fire's wake. We received little-to-no update until very late, only to find out her entire island hometown of Lahaina had been completely burned to ash. She will return with no house, no clothes, no car and a loss of momentos and memories. I'm hoping to source direct funds from the community, family members and friends in order to help Emma replace, rebuild and find ease as she navigates her return home to this tragic loss that has left her with nothing. All money donated will go directly to Emma."

Please help me support The Straka family with prayers, love, patience and anything you can do financially, as they deal with this devastation and try to heal and put their lives back together again. We will get these funds to the Starka family as soon as possible so they can get shelter and clothing. With much Aloha, The Koth Family"

They've lost the place they called home for so long as well as all their belongings that held so many memories for them. This family is one of the most loving, caring, and hard-working I have ever met and it truly breaks my heart that they are currently going through such a tough time. However, we are forever grateful they are all together and that they are okay. We are reaching out for any support that can be given to them to get them back on their feet. All funds raised will be used for housing, clothing, food, and any other necessities the family may need. Whether it's sharing this page or donating, any help, big or small is greatly appreciated."

We are still blessed to have our lives as many did not make it out in time! I have some family who live in other parts of the island who can house us for the time being, however all I have is my drivers license and a extra set of clothes.

They left our childhood home with just their three dogs and need assistance to help them get back on their feet. Funds will be transferred to our parents and any help is appreciated! Thank You!

We are deeply grateful that my grandparents, parents, three siblings, their pets, as well as my aunt, uncle, and their three children, are safe. However, they now find themselves relying on temporary shelters. Compounding the urgency of their situation, my grandparents suffer from COPD. My grandmother requires oxygen 24/7, making their displacement not just a matter of shelter but also a serious health concern. While I currently reside outside the disaster-stricken area and feel a profound sense of helplessness due to the distance, I am determined to do everything within my power to help. I, Maricris, am reaching out on behalf of the Estabillo and Balmores families to humbly request any monetary support you can offer. This will directly assist in supporting their immediate needs, ensuring my grandmother's health requirements are met, and in the eventual rebuilding of their homes. Every act of generosity, no matter the size, is deeply appreciated."

It is still heart-breaking every time we think about it but we have to remain strong as a family and as a community. It took us 20years to finally be able to purchase our own home that we can call our own. But within just two years of making our memories there, it was taken by the Lahaina fire. I know many families lost their home too, that is why any amount will do. Just something to get us through. We appreciate all your financial support, prayers and encouragement. Mahalo Nui Loa. GOD bless Lahaina!"

They evacuated from their home which was engulfed in flames to the Lahaina Civic center. Then ordered to evacuate once more to Napili park. With no to very little resources left. And signal on their cellphones. They decided that once the road opens back up, that they'll make their way back to Kahului & wailuku. My cousin Samantha called me as soon as they reached Maalaea. She asked if they can come to my house. And without hesitation I said come!!! And with the grace of god they are all accounted for and safe. They've lived and serviced Lahaina, Maui for more than 23 years. Proud church members. They are people that give and expect nothing in return. They are left without a home to return to. Please help them recover and heal from this devastating loss. Anything helps all funds will be used to help recover from being displaced during this difficult time."

Their house was competely burned to the ground. Most importantly, the Vasquez family is safe now. But as you can imagine, this will take a severe emotional and financial toll on them. They need support with your donations to help get them on their feet and start the long journey ahead. The funds raised will go directly to Eliza and Jojo to assist in getting their immediate essentials, replace belongings, acquire housing, and take the necessary steps to rebuild their lives."

Thankfully, my Aunty’s (Jelly Rose Calipjo Duran) home in Kahoma Village is one of the very few homes that was untouched by the fire. I am updating the info as to not give out false information. They are safe and was able to evacuate in time but are still stuck on the West Side of Maui. I just want to be able to help provide them with financial relief. Such as providing them with the funds to help clean their home of smoke and soot damage and replace anything that needs to be replaced (beds & other furniture, etc.)."

She was able to grab her phone and wallet but left with only the clothes on her back. They were able to escape by car to the bypass but when the fires got too close they were told to leave by police. Unfortunately the car wouldn't start and they were forced to run by foot from the thick black clouds and crazy winds. Thankfully a stranger picked her up and drove her to Wailuku where she is staying with a friend. I know there are so many resources and amazing people donating clothes and food but my mom is in America with a green card and it is critical that she get a new passport. So the money donated will be used for basic necessities as well as making sure she is able to get her paperwork in order."

We estimate about $75,000 in refunds that we will have to pay back in the coming weeks which we will honor. While insurance will be able to help recover some of the losses it will not be able to cover the $100s of thousand we poured into the building to make it what it was. The loss of tools, inventory, and so much more is hard to imagine. The devastating loss of customers' bikes that burned as well as local art and bikes showing the history of the sport were all lost.Finances raised will help keep our two other smaller shops stay in business and stay operational. We have 16 employees that we would like to take care of and keep as many on payroll as possible merging them into 2 stores. We will also use donations to help cover employees' personal items, cars, bikes and other belongings lost in the fire. As well as relocation assistance. Financially with all the refunds and struggles ahead, we could end upside down, but our passion and drive will remain strong and we will push forward."

The home has housed so many in the past. Please help donate anything you can. Send prayers for all of Maui, the disaster has affected us all."

We had to self-evacuate with no warning at all after the house filled with smoke and we could hardly see. The power had already been out since early that morning due to the high winds knocking down trees and power lines. We had all been hunkering down for the storm. We grabbed what clothes we could and packed into 3 cars. My mother, Anne, my 3 children (aged 3, 5, and 14) and I got stuck in the middle of the fire during evacuation and spent 2 hours watching the fire catch up to us and burn houses a sidewalks distance from our cars while stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. We are truly grateful to be alive and appreciate whatever you can give us. We need money for everything from clothing, people and pet food, essentials, housing, school supplies, toys, and all the things for daily living. Again thank you for anything you can offer.Mahalo,Noelani, Anne, Clem, Kayla, Kili & Mahea"

My brother has always had the most generous heart. He is the guy who welcomes everyone into his family and home without question or judgment- the one to make sure that neighbors and friends have enough food, to make sure everyone's kids have shoes to wear, and to ensure that the elders in the family and community are not just well-cared-for, but respected and honored as the treasures that they are. By supporting our GoFundMe campaign, you become an integral part of rebuilding what was lost. Your generosity will provide immediate relief, offering essentials such as clothing, food, and shelter to this family who has been left with nothing. Beyond their immediate needs, your contribution will help them to regain their sense of stability as they navigate their \"new normal\" with a renewed sense of hope through the support that you provide."

The Jacinto-Kaaikala’s have always been very giving and helpful to their community and all those around them. This family although resilient to whatever comes their way has already had a lot on their plate these past couple years and this fire destroyed everything. 100% of the funds will go to the Jacinto-Kaaikala  family as they start to take on this new obstacle of having to rebuild all that they lost. The money will go towards the building of their house, food, clothes, and health necessities. This family means the world to me and anything helps.

This very place holds countless wonderful memories, photographs, family photo albums and cherished items, all now lost to the flames. Even the images of my late father Cesar, but many of you remembered him as Charlie, have been consumed, as well as his iconic guitar. Your kind donations would mean the world to us, alleviating the weight of this overwhelming burden and the stress it brings. Your support is immensely appreciated.

Jillian is 41 and this pregnancy is a dream that has been a long time coming. They were so ready with everything perfect for the baby's arrival. Yesterday in the torrential Maui fire their home and belongings burned to ashes. They are pregnant and homeless. They didn't have much time and could only gather a few things. Their rental insurance recently canceled them for being too close to the ocean and they hadn't yet found a company that would insure them. For now, they are staying in a temporary shelter provided by friends until the baby arrives. Joel's newly started business burned, and his tools are gone. His parents home burned to the ground, and they have an autistic adult child to care for. His mother's place of work is also gone along with their whole neighborhood and all of Lahaina town. Our family is hurting beyond words. Any amount of money you could contribute would be very helpful and we would all be immensely grateful for your generosity in helping them rebuild their life. We also ask for your prayers for the safe and healthy delivery of this precious new one joining the world in the midst of all of this. We will keep you posted."

On behalf of our Ohana the Steiner’s, Ko’s and Marzon’s we hope you find it in your heart to contribute to help rebuild their lives. Our beautiful Lahaina was destroyed by the catastrophic events that happened on 8/8/23. The fire that ravaged our historic Lahaina Town, has affected the entire community. Homes, cars, jobs, businesses, historic monuments and sadly lives were lost. Like many families our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana (family) are devastated by the significant loss. Many of them lost their homes, vehicles, their livelihood (including businesses). Lahaina was our home, where we grew up, raised families and been a part of this tight knit community for generations. One of the homes lost was built by hand with the community & Habitat for Humanity. Although it was extremely difficult for the world to watch the fire destroy the home we all know and love. We can’t even begin to comprehend what they have been through and continue to go through, as they pick up the pieces and begin to rebuild their lives. Your donations whether big or small will help tremendously and will be used to rebuild the lives of our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana. We ask for your pule (prayer) for not only our Ohana but all of Lahaina. #lahainastrong"

My family's house was near the Lahaina bypass. My mom, niece, sisters, brother in law, and 2 year old nephew were separated during the fires but thankfully, are now all accounted for. They are currently staying in Kahului with friends and relatives but are still trying to recover from shock and after losing everything they have worked so hard for. I am so thankful that they are all safe and the challenge now is to find shelter and rebuild their lives. On behalf of my family, I am helping them fundraise to find housing in the meantime and rebuild what was lost. All funds will go directly to my family for necessities (food, diapers, clothes, etc) and financial needs. Every little thing and anything helps. Mahalo again. From my family to yours, thank you so much."

On August 8, 2023, my family lost the life that we spent over the last 30 years building, disappearing in the wind-fueled flames. I was born and raised in Lahaina right off of Front Street and my family had multiple businesses on Front Street for over 30 years so this tragedy has stripped us from the only life we've ever known. We were forced to leave our belongings, evacuate our home, and watch our home and family business burn into the ground with the rest of Front Street town. As a result of this tragedy, we would greatly appreciate donations of any amount so that my dad (Tien Doan), mom (Amy Doan), brother (Patrick Doan), sister (Celine Doan), and I can get back on our feet. We know that the Maui community will come together to rebuild Lahaina town very soon but until then, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share this post. If you are unable to donate, all I ask is that you pray for the Maui community during this time of loss and healing."

We live in Lahaina, specifically in the Wahikuli neighborhood, on Kahoma street. We are fundraising to get our life back together. I appreciate all of you and your generosity and thank you for your support. 48 hours ago I could only empathize but never imagined my life would be taken away from me like this. If I had one more moment in my home with my family, what would I have done? I would have had watched my dad enjoy one more beer in the comfort of his own home while he listened to his favorite country music or singing Karaoke and bbq on his grill. I would have praised my moms hard work as she finished a day of gardening. Her garden meant everything to her. I would had cherish her smile one last time, as she walked through her garden after a stressful day of work. I would have encouraged my dad to paint the porch, that he was working so hard to finish. I would have taken a longer look at the photos of my grandparents and reminisced on my childhood. I would have scanned the room and taken in the memories and love that was built in that home. OUR home."
