My name is Bobi Cuddihy and my brother Sanford Hill lost everything but the clothes on his back and his car in the Lahaina wildfire. Especially hard for him to lose was a lifetime of photography. Sanford is a kama'aina (born and raised in Hawaii). He moved to Maui in 1972, as a 20-year-old, when it was an undiscovered remnant of old Hawaii and before Lahaina became a tourist destination. Sanford is resilient and has the ho’omau (ability to persevere) but at his age it isn’t easy to start all over. He didn’t have much and doesn’t need much. He was living just on social security and in the senior low-income housing. But the cost of starting over in Hawaii is high. Your kindness, generosity, and Aloha to this GoFundMe campaign will go directly towards providing Sanford with the essentials – a safe shelter, clothing, food, and the means to start anew. Every dollar raised will play a crucial role in making a difference in rebuilding his life."

They've been faithfully devoted to serving their church and local communities for years. We know them as friends who have blessed our family without asking for anything in return and want to see them come out of this stronger than before. Immediately following the tragedy, they started helping out at their church, where hundreds of other evacuees are also taking refuge. Funds will be given directly to the head of their household and used to rebuild their lives, particularly during this intense time of shock and transition. If you want to help them in particular, or Maui in general, recover from this life-changing disaster, now is your chance!"

Unfortunately she has lost everything in the fires including important documents (passport & IDs) and fled with only the clothes on her back and left with friends & family. We are so blessed and thankful that she is alive as it was a scary few days after the fires that we were unable to get ahold of her or know the status of her well-being. She is still currently in Lahaina on the west side of Maui where there is very limited access to basic resources. We are hoping and praying that she & the others have access to food, water, and a bed to sleep in. We appreciate any donations, big or small to help my mother get back on her feet and recover from the horrific event. We plan to fly her to Vegas where we will open our home to her and continue to support and be there for her. Thank you very much for any help."

He is a significant part of the Lahaina community, coaching soccer for the Lahainaluna Girls Soccer team and the Lahaina Women's Soccer team for years. He has taken countless tourists to visit the humpback whales when he captained his boat out of Lahaina Harbor. We fondly remember how he would play classical music for the whales, a tip of his hat to our dad, Dr. Louis Rockett. Dave and his family are inspiring examples of aloha and the power of 'ohana. Even while he has lost so much, he is positive and boosting our spirits during this tragedy."

The house, along with hundreds of others, burned to the ground. My Mom is a Kishi, daughter of Richard (Kazuo) and Margaret. They owned and operated Kishi Market in Front Street for many many years. That building, sadly, is also no more. My Dad was a Realtor in West Maui for decades, helping countless clients find the perfect house for their families. He was self employed as Colley & Associates (the associates being my mom, and many times myself as chief envelope stuffer and filer of things as a child). This is intended to help them pay for supplies, transportation, and other basic necessities."

She immigrated from the Philippines almost 20 years ago and struggled here as a single parent raising three kids on her own as best as she could. My mom did everything she could for us, this is the only option I got. I understand with the economy we live in a majority of us already suffer living paycheck to paycheck.

My 92 year old mother, Wanda Kitaguchi (pictured in cover photo), was one of the many who lost their home. Left behind was all of her belongings (with the exception of a few essentials/couple pairs of clothes). She evacuated at the last minute alongside my daughter who also left home with close to nothing. It pains me to say that my brother who also resided with them there, Albert Kitaguchi, has still not been located since the night of 8/8. In efforts to look for my brother, my daughter drove through active fire/power lines/thick black smoke with little visibility on two separate occasions the night of the fire, and watched our home engulfed in flames. My mother, Wanda Kitaguchi, immigrated from Japan to Lahaina in 1953, alongside my Lahaina born father, James S. Kitaguchi (departed). So many memories, so much blood, sweat, and tears, countless irreplaceable family photo albums and memorabilia, journals upon journals of daily logs that my mom would write every evening, all of her \"broke da mouth\" recipes she has spent her whole life collecting from different people and places, gone into the ashes and rubble before they even knew it. Beyond the material things, our Wahikuli home held so much more meaning, history, and depth. Funds earned will go toward providing basic essential items, hotel stay costs, and potentially reestablishing their home in the far future."

On August 8th, 2023 in Lahaina, Maui, hurricane Dora passed south of the Hawaiian islands and brought widespread devastation from high winds and wildfires that destroyed everything in its path. My brother, his girlfriend and their dog were woken up from the smoke, flames and screams. Very confused and scared, they tried to get out of the area as fast as possible, but were met in gridlock with other vehicles. They barely made it out of the area alive. With no gas and damage to their van, they walked to kaanapali until they kept being told to move out towards Honokowai. They waited for days with no help. With no sleep, food and barely any water, they made a desperate decision to go back on foot to siphon gas from abandoned cars so they could hopefully drive back out to town. There was no warning that the fires were spreading quickly and we’re thankful that they are ok."

Anacleto came to Hawaii and worked the sugar plantation fields, building a life for our family. On August 9, 2023, our parents fled for their lives on Maui and lost their home in Lahaina, as well as their personal belongings, work tools, clothing, medical supplies, photos, and other family treasures to the fires. They fled without time to pack their things, so the clothes on their backs are all they have left. Our Mom and Dad are pillars of their community, and they are grounding in the support of their church community—where they are emergency sheltering and taking things day-to-day—right now. Despite losing nearly everything, they are committed to staying on Maui and helping their Ohana out and toward recovery, together. As Dad said, he will not leave his people."

They fled their home with only what they could carry, their dog Brandy and cat, Oso. Tasha is eight months pregnant and was supposed to be celebrating her birthday that day. Instead, she and Kevin fled to higher ground. They are waiting to return but expect to find that everything they owned was completely decimated by the fire. Kevin and Tasha are active members of the Lahaina community. Kevin is a boat captain for Makai Adventures. The boat Kevin captained was lost in the fire, leaving him with an uncertain future income. Tasha works as a server and bartender and hostess at the local Honu restaurant. No one knows if it’s still standing. I hope you’ll give anything you can to help them to replace their belongings and set up a new home for their growing family."

Jac and Andrew bought their home with every penny they had at a young age because they knew they wanted to grow a family in Lahaina. They rolled up their sleeves together, literally, and over the years spent hundreds of hours personally making the house into a \"home.\" After many years of slowly renovating and budget rebuilding, all while growing their family (having 3 children) they finally reached a point where they were comfortable and not sleeping in a construction zone. They entertained visitors and shared their space with many friends and co-workers. They planted a garden, raised chickens, hosted their children's birthdays, and shared the special memories of family life in Lahaina. Their sense of respect and community pride, appreciation for the culture, and knowledge of the land/ocean is astounding. Although Andrew and Jaclyn are safe and surrounded by family and support, I set up this Crowdfund for them, as they are too emotional at the moment. I know they are humble and I know they will use any funds to support themselves,\ntheir children, and/or the community in Lahaina. Their goal right now is to hang on to their burned land without having to foreclose in hopes to rebuild the \"home,\" not the house."

On August 8th my parents were impacted immensely by the wildfires that tore through Lahaina and burnt their house to the ground. My parents lived in south Lahaina on Front st, with our two loving sweet yellow labradors Molly & Dakota. They are mom and daughter ages 9 & 5. My mom ran a wonderful business from home supplying families in need with baby items which is what brought her to Lahaina. She was previously living in Makawao but moved to Lahaina due to how well her business was doing on the west side. The morning the fires broke out my mom was doing business in Kahului trying to get baby seats to a visiting family. They were trying to rush home, but when they reached the Maui ocean center they were met with road closures and traffic making it impossible to get home. They had to sleep on the side of the road & our dogs were home all alone. They were trying to get ahold of neighbors to grab the dogs before evacuating but there was no luck due to cell towers being down. We are really hoping that they got rescued and made it out safely but we will not know until everything is okay to return too. We still have gotten no word whether or not they are safe and are trying to remain hopeful. My parents lost everything, clothes, medicine, food, pictures, and so much more. 100% of the money raised will be going towards my parents to aid them with the rescue of our dogs, medicine, clothing, food, and basic essentials they need."

        "description": "My name is Cindy (Ching) and my dad (born in 1917), along with his brothers and sisters, was born and raised in Lahaina where they had a family store along Front Street in the 1930s. Most attended Lahainaluna, and some ventured to Oahu, Big Island, and Molokai. We're heartbroken for our three cousins who still live there and lost everything along with their homes. Deanna (and Ernie) Cabatingan, Wendy (and Wayne) Keanini, and Brandie Simon (Brenda's daughter). They are all lifelong Lahaina residents working in the community they love and are known for their generous and kind gestures to friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Wendy taught for over 30 years at King Kamehameha III Elementary School, which was also destroyed in the fire. We hope to show them the love and support that they gave to so many others.The funds will go directly to these three families that lost their homes in the devasting fires to help them rebuild their homes and lives in beautiful Lahaina. Any financial support is greatly appreciated, and I also believe the well-wishes on this site will give them the strength to recover from this tragedy."

Together with their rock star team of five other instructors (who also lost everything in the fire), they shared the beauty of Maui underwater with many people. Their business also helped spread the message of ocean conservation and local activism. This was their first home. They have opened that home and their hearts to so many of us. They would truly give the shirts off their backs to anyone in need. Please, if you can, help this family get back on their feet!"

The revered Fleming home Trinity shared with her ohana (roomies Luca, Ronnie, Micah, Jake, Leonard, Kala, and Zuzu) was burned to the ground by the Lahaina, Maui wildfires on the evening of August 8, 2023. Like so many others, Trinity lost everything, including her cherished surfboards and other seafaring equipment, furniture, clothing, shoes, bicycle, electronics, toiletries, vital record documents, etc.\n With the exception of her car, the clothes on her back, and a few donations she has since received, everything Trinity owned is gone. We are very lucky to have Trinity safe and with us today. For the past two years, she has dedicated her life to managing and growing the LahAina Surf Shack. Trinity considers her surf instructors, students, and their families as her ohana (family). Trinity coordinated and supported the families of the keiki (children's) programs at the surf shop; she also served as a community organizer for beach cleanups. Trinity has been part of the convoys transporting resources around the island, and as of Saturday, August 12, 2023 Trinity is now volunteering with the Red Cross in their community centers. She is also working to organize an ice pack exchange so that all of those displaced will have a way to keep their coolers cold. Maui is Trinity's life; there is nowhere else she calls home. Immediate needs include housing, a new laptop, and a surfboard - much needed for mental health!"

Their greatest need right now is basic things like clothing, toiletries, food, gas, etc. Kat also lost her business, Pomaika'i Therapeutic Massage. She ran her business out of her home. She is a 5 star massage therapist who loves her clients and brings much healing to them. She’s an amazing mom to her 2 children, Mahina (9) and Aharon (18). George is an amazing dad, well known and loved on the island and grew up in Lahaina. Together as a family with God, they will start a new chapter."

She is completely traumatized. She went to urgent care today because her lungs and throat were affected by smoke inhalation. Brie and her 12-year-old son both have asthma. The water is contaminated and the whole area is toxic. It's estimated to take up to two years to rebuild. Because of shared custody agreements, she's unable to move off the island. Please help Brie and her sons recover and heal from this devastating loss."

We would assist MEO and the Consulate of Mexico gather people needing passport and ID renewals. We are also a part of the Maria Lanakila Spanish-speaking community where my mom was a sacristan and a Sunday school teacher for over 10+ years. Growing up my brothers and I (pictured) were altar servers and lectors. My brothers are supposed to graduate from community college and high school this year.

Together with Grandma Emi, they worked hard over the next decade or so to make it a home and happily welcomed two more sisters (Sarah and Annabelle) with their families from the Phillipines, and Hesard's mother to live with them. At a full house of 10 there was always a lot of life here, a lot of memories made, a lot of memories kept. This was a home and a promise of a new life in America. This was a place to come home to at the end of the day, a place to stay, talk story, and sing karaoke with family, a place to celebrate birthdays and graduations, a place to be together and mourn the loss of loved ones, a place to play with all the family pets, a place to cook and enjoy delectable home cooked meals, and yes during Covid this was a place for school too. This home was full of life. Please, we are asking for help for the whole family to get back up on their feet, to begin again."

Consequently, they need help with food, clothing, medicine, transportation and shelter.

Thank God she was safe with her wonderful caregiver Tu'u on the other side of the island, at the time the fire occurred, but her ongoing treatment is a large financial expense that must be maintained. In 2018 he was awarded the \"Maui Peace Hero\" award for his selfless service to the community of Maui. Not only has he donated his time, talent, energy and resources for the greater good of Maui throughout his past 40+ years of residency, but has also served our country in the US Navy. Asking you from the bottom of my heart to help this wonderful man get back onto his feet so that he can continue to spread God's love, helping make miracles happen on Maui and throughout the world!"

The gravity of the situation is immense and tragic, striking all members of the community. In particular, my brother, Jordan, his wife, Tiff, and 1 year old son, Milo were victims of this fire. Luckily all three of them are safe but their whole possessional life has been lost to the fire. The fire not only burned through their neighborhood but burned to the harbor where my brother worked on numerous boats, destroying his entire work. His office, workshop, and his boats have been consumed by the fire. Additionally, his wife who is a professional photographer is now jobless too as the fire has halted tourism and most of her equipment was consumed in the fire. They now must find a way to provide for themselves and their young son, jobless and without a home to return to. Everything has been lost but two suitcases and their lives. The few words here can not fully encompass the devastation that has occurred. The funds raised here will go directly to them, helping to stabilize themselves amid the instability and insecurity disaster brings, as they navigate rebuilding their lives. All financial donations are appreciated along with prayers."

I am trying to help my grandpa and my uncle (his brother) raise money to help supply them food, clothes, & other essentials that they loss in the fire. Not only did they lose there house and everything they need but they also loss memories of my deceased great grandma and great grandpa that we can’t get back. When I got a hold of my grandpa he told me he was outside with a carpenter trying to fix up there house when the wind blew him trying to catch his fall, the fire then began to get bigger and bigger as the wind was soooo strong that they could already feel the heat of the fire coming there way, so of course they needed to evacuate ASAP, as they weren’t able to grab what they needed. If anybody can help donate it would be greatly appreciated. Mahalo Nui #PrayForMaui"

The house was erected in the mid-1950s by my late grandfather, Takeo, and it has been the humble home of my family ever since then. In the efforts to evacuate the house promptly, we were unable to secure anything else besides our family members (three elderly and two dogs, as well as my mother, father, and I). In that process, we were unable to secure any personal belongings and were forced to flee Lahaina with little more than the clothes on our backs. If you can find it in your heart, my family and I are asking for your generosity today.

Among these families is our niece's family, the Longgay family---Ronelyn, Christopher, and their baby girl Krislyn Claire. Katie is an auntie to Ronelyn on her father's side.

Although lucky to have been on the mainland visiting family and out of harm’s way, this also means they missed any opportunity to grab even their most cherished items. Your donations will help Sarah and Casey take the first steps to rebuilding their life together. Please also continue to send love and messages of support, as they’ve helped so much already. For those of you who don’t know Sarah or Casey, Sarah has also been a Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant for the last 10 years. We met during our initial training and lived together during our first year. Casey, affectionately known as Captain Casey, has been sailing with the Lahaina Yacht Club and many other tour boat operators for over 45 years."

It was more than just four walls and a roof; it represented all the sacrifice and obstacles my family overcame when they immigrated here to have a chance at achieving the \"American Dream.\" It was our gathering place, the center of every celebration and milestone we shared as a family, and it was our comfort, the safe space we turned to in times of difficulty. My family has never been one to ask for help, but today I'm asking for your help on their behalf. We need a little bit of hope to start rebuilding.

Many have lost their loved ones, their homes and have been displaced in the recent fire that sweeped across parts of Maui. I am creating this Gofundme on behalf of this beautiful family who have taken my sister in as their own, even when they themselves were looking for a place to call their own. Unfortunately, after they finally were able to move into a home. The Lahaina fires took that away within seconds. They lost everything in this fire and will need to start over. These funds will be assisting a single mom who has been taking care of 5 children ages 10- 17. We hope to help them in getting the necessities to start again.

Their home was in Lahaina, where they loved spending time in their backyard with their adorable 3 year old rescue dog, Haku. They recently were married on Maui in April, using many Lahaina vendors and locations for their celebrations.They love celebrating all that Maui has to offer and support local businesses and local Hawaiians."

Kyle took over the business in 2018, and built a culture that prioritized community, caring and friendship. Folks would come from all over and learn to surf with teachers who practice Aloha in every way. When the fires came on August 8, 2023, there was no preparation for the devastation. The shop- ironically an historic building, the old fire station- burned to the ground and reduced to ash. From aerial photos it is clear nothing survived. The employees have lost everything. Most are now homeless and now have lost their livelihoods for the time being. We are thankful that all employees have been accounted for, it is going to be a long road of rebuilding. We learned that Kyle does not have property insurance. He is applying for every federal loan available, but it is not enough. We are devastated that our beloved shop is gone.

A place they have called home for 18 years completely gone in the blink of an eye. Their home and all contents are gone and they left with their animals and the clothes on their backs but nothing else. My stepmother Anne is a partner for Starbucks and over the years has been very active in giving back to their community doing food drives and many other donation events. It is our time to give back to them when they need it most. Anything at all help. And please continue to pray for the people of Lahaina.

Her husband, my son in law Marcus, is still missing. The last she heard from him was him trying to race home to get her. Cell service was lost and no one has heard from him since.Imagine being away on a work trip and in the mainland when this all unfolded. I have so much guilt as I should have been there to save them all. We lost everything on Fleming Rd.

We have been sleeping in the car the past couple nights. So many in my town lost our homes. We don't have access to housing because there was already a severe shortage of homes in my town. Some of my family members can't go back to work because they lost their workplaces too in the fire. The funds will be used to replace what we lost in the fire. We lost all our clothes, belongings, furniture, kitchen and bathroom things, even important documents. My grandma lost her car that melted in the fire. Please, every little bit helps.

Uncle Remy, Royale and Randal evacuated quickly and sadly had to leave all of their possessions behind. They were also forced to make the heartbreaking decision to leave behind their family pets that included 9 cats (Chong, Shadow, Ghost, Whisper, Stoney, Meanie, Goldie, Tiny and Nanu), 8 chickens and 2 lovebirds (Rocky and Adrian). If you know our Maui family you know that they are always the life of the party, where at any time any one of them can tell the funniest story, makes us laugh with crazy jokes or entertain us with beautiful voices. We understand that many across the island of Maui are dealing with the devastation so any donation given is greatly appreciated. The funds raised will help provide the family with the means to purchase groceries and all other necessities for day-to-day living. It will also give them peace of mind as they try to sort out how they are going to get through this as they start their search for housing and employment."

My grandmother and parents are the most hard-working individuals I know, and to see everything they've worked for disappear in an instant is truly heartbreaking, so this is my way of giving back to them.

My mom and uncle grew up in that house with so many memories there with family and friends. My grandparents along with my cousin and his pregnant girlfriend were residents of the house. My grandparents lives work was turned to ash in such a short matter of time. My moms childhood home is gone and lost to the fire. My grandparents left homeless with no clothes and scarce food sources. My grandma is left with no job as her shop burnt down with the rest of Front Street. My grandparents work very hard to give their 5 grandchildren anything they can. Please give anything you can big or small to help my grandparents rebuild and buy any everyday needs such as clothes etc. Mahalo, for all the blessings and support you guys have given. Please share on any social media platforms to help my grandparents get back on their feet."

She is one among many who have lost their home, job and livelihood in the structure fire's devastation. Many community members were forced to evacuate their homes with only a few minutes or less to prepare. I am so grateful Emma is safe and non-injured, as she has been visiting me off-island, but it was a long night of no contact with neighbors and friends whose powerlines were destroyed in the fire's wake. We received little-to-no update until very late, only to find out her entire island hometown of Lahaina had been completely burned to ash. She will return with no house, no clothes, no car and a loss of momentos and memories. I'm hoping to source direct funds from the community, family members and friends in order to help Emma replace, rebuild and find ease as she navigates her return home to this tragic loss that has left her with nothing. All money donated will go directly to Emma."

My family has been in Lahaina since 1994 after my parents immigrated from the Phillippines to seek a better life in the U.S. After 30 years of supporting my siblings and me through long hours of arduous back-breaking work in the tourism industry, this disaster has left them without a home, taking everything from our beloved backyard garden to the mailbox at the end of our driveway. They had been so proud to be able to afford a house that they could call theirs, that would serve as a place for so many family reunions for me, my siblings (Len, Nelson, and Rhon) and our young families. Just four months ago we were visiting the people and places that shaped me into who I am today. Those places no longer exist. My mom, Leony, my dad, Leo, and my brother's partner, Haley, were living in the home before the fire and now are left without a place to call home. This nightmare is something we could have never imagined.Any amount that you can contribute will go directly to getting my heartbroken family back on their feet and rebuilding our family home. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

Dave was the executive head chef there, putting his heart and soul into creating the menu from the ground up, and embracing the island foods while adding his own Colorado flare. It was a labor of love that was caught in this horrific event on Wednesday. Melissa has lived on the islands for over ten years and currently works with the Maui, Molokai, and Lanai schools in special education with an emphasis in working with deaf and hard of hearing children often traveling between all three islands. If you know these two, you are aware of how they embody aloha. Friends for almost 20 years, I’ve worked with Melissa, lived with her, and she has become an auntie to my children and pets. They are the kindest and most deserving individuals we know and she would give the shirt off her back for a friend or stranger. Now that they need our help, it’s time to give all that we can to help them get back on their feet and get back to work. Our hearts are broken but we know that this community can come together and rebuild.

        "description": "Hi, my name is Heather. My aunty Sally, uncles Prudencio & Fernando and cousins, Stef, Jason & Samantha lost their home in Lahaina, Maui during the brush fire on 8/8/2023. They evacuated from their home which was engulfed in flames to the Lahaina Civic center. Then ordered to evacuate once more to Napili park. With no to very little resources left. And signal on their cellphones. They decided that once the road opens back up, that they'll make their way back to Kahului & wailuku. My cousin Samantha called me as soon as they reached Maalaea. She asked if they can come to my house. And without hesitation I said come!!! And with the grace of god they are all accounted for and safe. They've lived and serviced Lahaina, Maui for more than 23 years. Proud church members. They are people that give and expect nothing in return. They are left without a home to return to. Please help them recover and heal from this devastating loss. Anything helps all funds will be used to help recover from being displaced during this difficult time."

Just around the corner from their house, they also lost the home which housed two of their sons. While they are so grateful that their family is safe and accounted for, now comes the daunting task of rebuilding their homes and reestablishing their deep roots in the Lahaina community. Kim has always been there for his community, on the water, in his shops, at the schools, at surf competitions, at his church, and all over this island—and he would never ask for anything, but their ohana needs our support."

She was able to grab her phone and wallet but left with only the clothes on her back. They were able to escape by car to the bypass but when the fires got too close they were told to leave by police. Unfortunately the car wouldn't start and they were forced to run by foot from the thick black clouds and crazy winds. Thankfully a stranger picked her up and drove her to Wailuku where she is staying with a friend. I know there are so many resources and amazing people donating clothes and food but my mom is in America with a green card and it is critical that she get a new passport. So the money donated will be used for basic necessities as well as making sure she is able to get her paperwork in order."

We are born and raised in Lahaina and it’s been so heartbreaking to see all the damage. We are so blessed they are all SAFE! My sister Shannon Ii, her partner Michael Asami, nieces, parents Glenn and Lehua Ii lost everything. We live on the continent (Oregon and Vegas) and have been feeling so helpless so we’re raising funds to help support them directly in anything they need. We are in direct contact with them whenever they have service. The cover photo is of my sisters home. They are safe but have nothing but the clothes on their backs. Thank you for all your love, support, and prayers. Please share and we will rebuild!"

We estimate about $75,000 in refunds that we will have to pay back in the coming weeks which we will honor. While insurance will be able to help recover some of the losses it will not be able to cover the $100s of thousand we poured into the building to make it what it was. The loss of tools, inventory, and so much more is hard to imagine. The devastating loss of customers' bikes that burned as well as local art and bikes showing the history of the sport were all lost.Finances raised will help keep our two other smaller shops stay in business and stay operational. We have 16 employees that we would like to take care of and keep as many on payroll as possible merging them into 2 stores. We will also use donations to help cover employees' personal items, cars, bikes and other belongings lost in the fire. As well as relocation assistance. Financially with all the refunds and struggles ahead, we could end upside down, but our passion and drive will remain strong and we will push forward."

Our dad is still working at the Westin trying to aid to the residents and figuring out the next steps moving forward. So with that being said I have set up a gofundme account to help aid our Arcangel Ohana with anything necessary."

My son Rob and his beautiful wife Michaellyn (born and raised on Maui), along with their 13 year- old son, their 8-year-old twin boys, and their 6 -year old son, fled their burning neighborhood with their 4 dogs and land turtle leaving behind the family guinea pigs and pet rabbits and all their belongings. They are safe and sheltering in Napili but this beautiful family and their community have lost everything and will need to rebuild their lives from scratch. We won't know the true loss of the Lahaina community until the fires are contained. Thank you in advance for helping this family rebuild."

As we come together as a community, we humbly ask for your support in helping rebuild his family’s life from the ashes."

Because of the fire now 11 family members including Arsenio Jacinto, Dawn Kaaikala-Jacinto, Arthur Jacinto, Kalalani Kaaikala, Makana Kaaikala and Malino Jacinto to name a few, no longer have a place to call home. The Jacinto-Kaaikala’s have always been very giving and helpful to their community and all those around them. This family although resilient to whatever comes their way has already had a lot on their plate these past couple years and this fire destroyed everything. 100% of the funds will go to the Jacinto-Kaaikala  family as they start to take on this new obstacle of having to rebuild all that they lost. The money will go towards the building of their house, food, clothes, and health necessities. This family means the world to me and anything helps. If able, please donate as little or as much as you want and most importantly please share.Thank you so much."

        "description": "Aloha, I am Charvie Duque. Our residence was in Lahaina on the beautiful island of Maui. A devastating fire has taken away all that we possessed. Our parents dedicated their life savings to secure this cherished home where me and my sister Valerie grew up. This home was so special to us that I decided to bring up my daughter, Charlie Joy, in this beautiful place. This very place holds countless wonderful memories, photographs, family photo albums and cherished items, all now lost to the flames. Even the images of my late father Cesar, but many of you remembered him as Charlie, have been consumed, as well as his iconic guitar. Your kind donations would mean the world to us, alleviating the weight of this overwhelming burden and the stress it brings. Your support is immensely appreciated. These funds will help us immediately bring shelter and comfort to our Ohana."

I'm going home soon to help locate and volunteer where possible/needed & try to help them get back on there feet. Whatever I can raise for them since they're not into social media anyways will help get them back on there feet and hopefully somewhere to stay and anything they may need. ANYTHING HELPS!

Their apartment was completely burnt to the ground, and they have lost everything they own, and thankfully with immense help from first responders, they were evacuated and are now safe. Because of this trajedy, Eden is currently without a home, and also without a job. The coffee shop she was working at, was also completely destroyed, leaving her without a job to provide for her boys as a single mama.

Please, if you find it in your hearts to be able to donate anything you can, we are looking to raise enough funds to support her housing for the next 6 months to a year, beds, furniture, food, cost of transportation to and from school for the boys, counseling and trauma care.

Jillian is 41 and this pregnancy is a dream that has been a long time coming. They were so ready with everything perfect for the baby's arrival. Yesterday in the torrential Maui fire their home and belongings burned to ashes. They are pregnant and homeless. They didn't have much time and could only gather a few things. Their rental insurance recently canceled them for being too close to the ocean and they hadn't yet found a company that would insure them. For now, they are staying in a temporary shelter provided by friends until the baby arrives. Joel's newly started business burned, and his tools are gone. His parents home burned to the ground, and they have an autistic adult child to care for. His mother's place of work is also gone along with their whole neighborhood and all of Lahaina town. Our family is hurting beyond words. Any amount of money you could contribute would be very helpful and we would all be immensely grateful for your generosity in helping them rebuild their life. We also ask for your prayers for the safe and healthy delivery of this precious new one joining the world in the midst of all of this. We will keep you posted."

Homes, cars, jobs, businesses, historic monuments and sadly lives were lost. Like many families our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana (family) are devastated by the significant loss. Many of them lost their homes, vehicles, their livelihood (including businesses). Lahaina was our home, where we grew up, raised families and been a part of this tight knit community for generations. One of the homes lost was built by hand with the community & Habitat for Humanity. Although it was extremely difficult for the world to watch the fire destroy the home we all know and love. We can’t even begin to comprehend what they have been through and continue to go through, as they pick up the pieces and begin to rebuild their lives.

My family's house was near the Lahaina bypass. My mom, niece, sisters, brother in law, and 2 year old nephew were separated during the fires but thankfully, are now all accounted for. They are currently staying in Kahului with friends and relatives but are still trying to recover from shock and after losing everything they have worked so hard for. I am so thankful that they are all safe and the challenge now is to find shelter and rebuild their lives. On behalf of my family, I am helping them fundraise to find housing in the meantime and rebuild what was lost. All funds will go directly to my family for necessities (food, diapers, clothes, etc) and financial needs. Every little thing and anything helps. Mahalo again. From my family to yours, thank you so much."

        "description": "I am making this GoFundMe on behalf of my family because we lost our home and family business in the recent fire disaster in Lahaina. On August 8, 2023, my family lost the life that we spent over the last 30 years building, disappearing in the wind-fueled flames. I was born and raised in Lahaina right off of Front Street and my family had multiple businesses on Front Street for over 30 years so this tragedy has stripped us from the only life we've ever known. We were forced to leave our belongings, evacuate our home, and watch our home and family business burn into the ground with the rest of Front Street town. As a result of this tragedy, we would greatly appreciate donations of any amount so that my dad (Tien Doan), mom (Amy Doan), brother (Patrick Doan), sister (Celine Doan), and I can get back on our feet. We know that the Maui community will come together to rebuild Lahaina town very soon but until then, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share this post. If you are unable to donate, all I ask is that you pray for the Maui community during this time of loss and healing."

If you ever shopped around Front St. and walked into Lahaina Jewelry, you would’ve seen my mom’s radiant smile. Mom had her business for over 30 years and her favorite part of the job was meeting all the wonderful customers. My family are currently safe but they lost everything. I’m hoping and praying if you can find it in your heart to donate any amount to help my family get back on their feet and if you’re unable to donate, all I ask for is to pray for everyone on Maui and their Ohana.

We don’t know for sure yet, but it is likely that our house has burned along with a large majority of Lahaina town...I am praying for Maui, our friends and family, and our first responders. If you have the capacity to support financially, it will be greatly appreciated. Mahalo & May God bless you."

We live in Lahaina, specifically in the Wahikuli neighborhood, on Kahoma street. We are fundraising to get our life back together. I appreciate all of you and your generosity and thank you for your support. 48 hours ago I could only empathize but never imagined my life would be taken away from me like this. If I had one more moment in my home with my family, what would I have done? I would have had watched my dad enjoy one more beer in the comfort of his own home while he listened to his favorite country music or singing Karaoke and bbq on his grill. I would have praised my moms hard work as she finished a day of gardening. Her garden meant everything to her. I would had cherish her smile one last time, as she walked through her garden after a stressful day of work. I would have encouraged my dad to paint the porch, that he was working so hard to finish. I would have taken a longer look at the photos of my grandparents and reminisced on my childhood. I would have scanned the room and taken in the memories and love that was built in that home. OUR home."
